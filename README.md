I'm an Android, Web &amp; Zoho CRM Developer.  I’ve spent the past 3+ years working across different areas of android development; front-end development, app UI/UX, to my current role designing products for mobile platforms.  My days are spent researching, designing, prototyping, coding.  Away from the laptop you’ll find me dreaming of soccer, cooking, and playing volleyball.
